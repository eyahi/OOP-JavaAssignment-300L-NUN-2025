## Project Description

This Android application allows users to search for flights and hotels, book them, and view or cancel bookings. The app provides a modern, intuitive interface with date pickers, list views, and clear navigation between activities. It simulates a basic travel booking system with locally stored data for demonstration purposes.

# Object-Oriented Principles Demonstrated

###  Encapsulation
Each class such as `Flight`, `Hotel`, `Booking`, and `Customer` encapsulates its own data and behavior. Attributes are marked as `private` and accessed via `getters` and `setters`.

### Association
Classes like `Booking` associate multiple objects â€” a `Booking` may reference both a `Flight` and a `Hotel`, showing real-world relationships.

### Separation of Concerns
The `TravelService` class acts as a **service layer**. It separates the appâ€™s **business logic** (searching, booking, canceling) from the **UI logic** in Activities. This makes the codebase cleaner and easier to maintain or scale.
