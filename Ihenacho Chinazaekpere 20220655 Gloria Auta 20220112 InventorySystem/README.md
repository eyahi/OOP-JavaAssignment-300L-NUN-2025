ENCAPSULATION;
Through the principle of encapsulation meaning i have some internal data hidden and they are gotten through a controlled access: 
I have attributes marked as private(including productId, name, stockQuantity), and i access them using public getters and setters.

ASSOCIATION;
Through the principle of association a class depends or uses another to function.
for instance the InventoryGUI is dependent on data from the Inventory.java folder
